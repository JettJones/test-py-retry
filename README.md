Ideas
------
Functionality
- [DONE] supports N retries
- [DONE] supports retry until deadline
- [DONE] exponential backoff
- other backoff algorithm?

Perf
- [DONE] Added execution time on success
- dependencies of library  (query from pypi ?)
  - info/requires_dist
  - info/home_page -> (should be github)
- size of library

Support
  - project age
  - bug count
  - release frequency
- license

Compat
- async
- generators
- other libraries
- python versions

Project UI
-----------
Imagining a github hosted page with test results.
- could turn test output into the resulting tables?
